      <p>Zakat is the third pillar of Islam and is a form of worship that involves wealth. However, it is obligatory
        upon Muslims to pay a portion of his earnings once in a lunar (Hijra) year to the poor and the needy when their
        earnings reach a prescribed amount (called “Nisab” ) above their needs. Commanded to the Muslims in the second
        year of Hijra Allah (SWT) says in the Holy Qur’an:
        <br><br>
        <small> “And establish regular Prayer and give Zakah, and bow down your heads with those who bow down (in
          prayer).” (2:43)

      <p>It will be essential to motivate, guide and support social change towards sustainable practices at all scales
        of governance — globally, nationally and individually. Simply setting ambitious goals will not generate these
        changes: their formulation must include details of the processes needed to achieve them. For example, SDG
        targets should take into account ideologies, religious beliefs and institutions, including formal and informal
        rules and customs.</p><br>
